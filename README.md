The DriverPass project designed a driving test preparation system with online courses, lesson scheduling, and progress tracking. I translated user requirements into functional specifications, ensuring the system was aligned with client expectations. This made the platform practical, user-friendly, and highly effective.

To enhance documentation, I’d make it more concise and organized, improving comprehension for developers and users

Thorough analysis of goals using use cases ensured the system addressed critical functionalities like flexible scheduling and progress tracking. Prioritizing user needs is key for efficient systems.

My structured process involves requirement analysis, defining use cases, creating system models, and iterative prototyping based on feedback.

In the future, I’d refine requirements gathering by incorporating iterative feedback loops. This would lead to a more user-centered design and adaptable software solutions.
